--NOTE: Message
An email message containing the sender, recipients, subject, and body. After a message has been created, a message cannot be changed.

--NOTGE: Thread
A collection of related messages forming a conversation. In an email client app, a thread is formed when one or more recipients respond to a message with their own message.

--NOTE: Draft
An unsent message. A message contained within the draft can be replaced. Sending a draft automatically deletes the draft and creates a message with the SENT system label.

--NOTE: Label
A mechanism for organizing messages and threads. For example, the label "taxes" might be created and applied to all messages and threads having to do with a user's taxes.

--NOTE System labels
Internally-created labels, such as INBOX, TRASH, or SPAM. These labels cannot be deleted or modified. However, some system labels, such as INBOX can be applied to, or removed from, messages and threads.

--NOTE: User labels
Labels created by a user. These labels can be deleted or modified by the user or an application.

--NOTE: Initial Load with Pagination: Fetch a reasonable number of messages or threads initially (e.g., first page with pagination tokens) and display them. Load more data (e.g., next page) on demand.

--NOTE: Lazy Loading: Fetch data as needed (e.g., when a user scrolls or clicks to expand a thread), minimizing the initial load time and improving perceived performance.

--NOTE: Pre-fetching: Fetch some data in advance that you anticipate the user will likely access, based on their previous interactions or typical usage patterns.

--NOTE: Server-Side Rendering: Format and render the data on the server side before sending it to the client. This can reduce the client's processing load and ensure consistent rendering.

////////////////
--NOTE: 4. Pagination or Lazy Loading
If the large HTML content can be split into smaller parts, consider using pagination or lazy loading to send the content in chunks.
